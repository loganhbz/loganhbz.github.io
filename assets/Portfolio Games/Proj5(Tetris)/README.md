# 3D Rendered Tetris

This game was made for my Computer Graphics (CSC 462) class.
It is rendered in WebGL.

Arrow keys control the pieces: 
    UP- rotate
    LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN - move direction indicated
    
w,a,s,d,e,q - Move the playing field in the corresponding direction (X/Y/Z)
W,A,S,D,E,Q - Rotate the playing field in the corresponding direction (X/Y/Z)

Main code in rasterize.js
