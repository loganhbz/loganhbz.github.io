This game was made for my Intro to Game Desgin (CSC 281) class

Stranded by McKenna Owens and Logan Hobbs - Readme file

Stranded is an interactive story where you are stranded on a deserted island, with no recollection of recent events. No clue where you are. No clue what this is. No clue who you are. You have to brave the island and collect materials to aid in your survival. Explore the beach, the forest, and the caves on the island in order to find new ways to help your escape. Your choices will affect your success down the line so every choice you make counts. Will you survive???

	CHEAT SHEET
To get the “easiest” outcome - best chance of success
* Choose “start thinking” from the start. Building the signal will grant more resources later.
* Continue, then choose “Find more materials for a better signal”
* Continue, then choose “Go to the reflecting light”
* Choose “Get the metal”
* Continue, then choose “Look for wood” and “Light the brush”
* Here is a randomly generated outcome (⅙ chance of failing the fire), you want to go back and redo the last passage to get the node for the “blowing on the brush” mechanic
* Continue to set up shelter, and then find the treehouse. There is the “climbing” mechanic to climb up the ladder.
* Continue, then choose “Take the tarp”
* Choose “Explore”
* Continue until you start looking for more food. There is the “pull” mechanic to pull food out of the sand.
* Continue, then choose “Middle” when asked what cave to go down. Here is hidden writing on the wall.
* Continue until you see “Brace yourself”. This is the “bracing” mechanic, to save yourself from crashing your raft. Because of your metal resources, you will have a good chunk of time to get through the sandbar.
* Continue to end

Some nodes have several different possible text displays (if’s and else’s) based on what you have chosen in the past. Your path will affect whether you will live or die when pushing your raft out into the ocean. Not having enough materials will cause a death.
Exploring the forest and choosing to pick the mushrooms starts a side story where you acquire a companion, which is referenced in later nodes.
